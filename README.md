# Dotfiles

## What?

This is my personal dotfile collection, managed by [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot).

## Why?
It's useful for me to have my config under source control, so that it's: backed up, versioned and shareable between multiple computers. 

It's also potentially useful for others. Much of the config here was taken from looking at other people's Dotfiles.
